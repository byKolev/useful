**Drupal**
==============================================

Drupal is an open source content management platform supporting a variety of
websites ranging from personal weblogs to large community-driven websites. For
more information, see the Drupal website at https://www.drupal.org, and join
the Drupal community at https://www.drupal.org/community.

**Modules**

[Administration menu](https://www.drupal.org/project/admin_menu) - Provides a theme-independent administration interface (aka. "navigation", "back-end"). It's a helper for novice users coming from other CMS, a time-saver for site administrators, and useful for developers and site builders.
Administrative links are displayed in a CSS/JS-based menu at the top on all pages of your site. It not only contains regular menu items â€” tasks and actions are also included, enabling fast access to any administrative resource your Drupal site provides.

[Adminimal Administration Menu](https://www.drupal.org/project/adminimal_admin_menu) - Adminimal Administration Menu changes the style of the Administration menu module. It adds a nice and simple minimalist look and provides some tweaks to improve your Drupal administration experience. The menu hierarchy is now simpler and easier to understand (removing the unnecessary transparency and only highlighting the correct menus). It also adds quick shortcut links that can be edited from the core shortcut module. The shortcuts fit nicely and have a small icon that separates them from the normal admin menu links.

[Chaos tool suite (ctools)](https://www.drupal.org/project/ctools) - This suite is primarily a set of APIs and tools to improve the developer experience. It also contains a module called the Page Manager whose job is to manage pages. In particular it manages panel pages, but as it grows it will be able to manage far more than just Panels.

[CKEditor - WYSIWYG HTML editor](https://www.drupal.org/project/ckeditor) - This module will allow Drupal to replace textarea fields with the CKEditor - a visual HTML editor, usually called a WYSIWYG editor. This HTML text editor brings many of the powerful WYSIWYG editing functions of known desktop editors like Word to the web. It's very fast and doesn't require any kind of installation on the client computer.

[Elysia Cron](https://www.drupal.org/project/elysia_cron) - Elysia Cron extends Drupal standard cron, allowing a fine grain control over each task and several ways to add custom cron jobs to your site.

[Features](https://www.drupal.org/project/features) - The features module enables the capture and management of features in Drupal. A feature is a collection of Drupal entities which taken together satisfy a certain use-case. Features provides a UI and API for taking different site building components from modules with exportables and bundling them together in a single feature module. A feature module is like any other Drupal module except that it contains additional information in its info file so that configuration can be checked, updated, or reverted programmatically.

**Themes**

[Adminimal - Responsive Administration Theme](https://www.drupal.org/project/adminimal_theme)

[Ember](https://www.drupal.org/project/ember) - Ember is a responsive administration theme built for use with the Spark, Lightning, and Demo Framework distributions.

**Drush** - [Drush](http://www.drush.org/en/master/) is a command line shell and Unix scripting interface for Drupal. Drush core ships with lots of useful commands for interacting with code like modules/themes/profiles. Similarly, it runs update.php, executes sql queries and DB migrations, and misc utilities like run cron or clear cache. Drush can be extended by 3rd party commandfiles.
